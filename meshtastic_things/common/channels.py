"""Channel naming convention: "<measurement>.<field>".

A *channel* is one addressable timeseries.
InfluxDB's pairs (measurement, field) into single strings.
This vocabulary is shared by (all need to be the same):

  - blueprint inputs/outputs (registry's PostprocessingStep)
  - quality thresholds (mesh.quality_config.v1's key)
  - the streams per-channel keying (flink/pattern_detection_job.py)
  - the batches (quality_worker/influx_io.py)

Naming must be the same as writer/point_builders.py, which is what defines
the InfluxDB measurement name. Each telemetry sub-metric dict becomes its own
measurement, and everything else uses its payload kind.
